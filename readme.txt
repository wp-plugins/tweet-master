With Tweet Master plugin you can display your latest tweets, favourite twitter lists and tweet button.

== Description ==

By far the best Twitter Tweets integration for Wordpress websites. With Tweet Master you can display your latest tweets and or your favourite Twitter lists inside any widget position of your wordpress template. Besides your tweets display we also included a nice tweet button with bubble count reinforced with Via, Recommend and Hashtag. Your users and visitors can easily share your page boosting your website visits and social engagement.

Since we are obsessed with clean, error free code and page load times, we made sure the widget updates your tweets in a blink of an eye without stalling it if twitter is responding slowly. And now you ask, how did you achieve that? The plugin is based upon the twitter widget when it comes to sizes and colours but we packed the module with it's own iframe and html5.

With Tweets Master you can professionally display your twitter tweets and integrate it into your wordpress like a chameleon.

Again and as usual with TechGasp extensions, the code is pristine, error free and with fast page loading times. Professional or business pages need to be fast and gain google seo rank.

All widgets are fully mobile devices responsive, a must for any professional website
